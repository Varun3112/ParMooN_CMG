The MNIST dataset contains three files 'mnist1,2,3,4,5,6.csv'
Combine these files into a single file called mnist1.csv to get the
full dataset.
This file now contains 70000 rows and 785 columns 
When this is read by the Armadillo, it is same as 70000 columns 
and 785 rows. (Armadillo operates on column major rank)

First 784 columns of the file are pixel values for digits.
The last column of the file is the label in [1,10] range.

The original MNIST dataset is taken from mlpack tutorial:
https://github.com/mlpack/examples

The instructions for downloading the data are given in README.md in
the above github repo.

The driver file for this tutorial is ANNPrograms/ANN_MNIST.C
Associated .dat file (ann_mnist.dat) is included in this directory.


Instructions:
1. Change the UserConfig.cmake to run ANNPrograms/ANN_MNIST.C
2. Copy the ann_mnist.dat file to the output location (usually ../ParMooN_Output)
3. Make changes to the dat file if required
4. Run the program
