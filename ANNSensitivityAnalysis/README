This directory contains all the Python scripts for the sensitivity analysis.
The Scripts RunExpt.py, Run1HL.py, Run2HL.py, Run3HL.py are used for running the
forward experiments with different ANN architectures. Copy these scripts into
the ParMooN Output directory (where the exe will be created). Make sure that the
.exe is named as "parmoon_2D_SEQUENTIAL.exe" as well as the training dataset is 
named as "trainingData.csv". Rest everything is automated.

The script creates an output directory called 'output' and a project dir inside that
called 'ANN'. Then depending on the run, it will create different folders starting from
0,1,... . i.e. if the user runs this script for the first time, 
then the folder will be 0. For the next run, a new folder '1' will be created and so on.

Inside this run directory, all the data will be written in different folders. i.e. if the
user is interested in 100 ANN architectures, then folders 0 through 99 will be created to
store the output results (test results) of the network. Moreover, the run directory will
also have a metadata file and a inputSpace file which will store the input parameter space
for the sensitivity analysis. 

The range of the input parameter space is defined in Run1HL.py, Run2HL.py and Run3HL.py 
(1,2,3HL stands for hidden layers). You can change the input parameter space by tweaking this.

To run the script, type
python3 RunExpt.py
